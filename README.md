### Idea Proposals

When you get a chance, please go to the [google doc](https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fa%2Fbrown.edu%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1YvS65TMgg1zo8SPbgBpG0cjHRxWPDzj_cXEe0hxpEzs%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&h=1AQHf2CEM) and try filling in the following:

* What question do you want to answer?
* What is the impact of answering this question?
* How would you answer it? What tools would you need? How much time do you think it will take? (Optional)

Everyone should be able to answer the first two questions, but the third one may be more difficult. Make your best guess at answering it but it's ok if you're unsure.
